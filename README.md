# Responsive Restaurant Reviews App
---
This application is designed to allow you to access reviews for a range of restaurants in New York City. The app has been designed with accessibility in mind, so you should be able to use it across a wide range of devices, including mobile and screen readers.

## Responsive

This app automatically resizes to fit the screen and orientation you are viewing it on - so you should be able to use it just as well on a mobile, tablet, or monitor.

## Accessible

This app can be navigated using mouse or keyboard. When using the tab key to navigate, a dropdown menu will appear to allow you to easily jump to the section you prefer.

## Available offline

This app includes a caching feature - so once you have visited a page, you can always see it again - even if you lose internet connection. Neat!
